### Pirates vs zombies - a simple design ###

--- Intro ---
Okey, first idea I get when looking at the theme, is a typical Pirates of
the caribean theme. And since we only have like 3 days to make it, we
need a really simple game, how about building it on top of the
RubyDogfight game?

When you have pirates and zombies as main characters, and the first
thing I think about is pirates of the caribean, I want to be a pirate... the
zombies are known to be "the bad guys". So, we are pirates!

--- First steps --- 
* First thing we need to do with the RubyDogFight game, is to change the plane models to pirates.
* Second thing is to lower the velocity while not pressing the [move] buttons, so we get a feeling of walking.
* Third is offcourse to change the background to some ship "model", maybe it should be a pier next to the ship aswell, if the ship havn't been lanched yet.

--- Basic Features ---
Whit this as our base, we have a basic game idea, now to add features:

* Collision - When we have a ship "model" we need collision, you can't
just walk out of the "model" onto the water without drowning or getting
stopped by the ship fence (if there is a fence, it might be brokend after
all!), and you can't just walk into the ship structures and mainmast either.

* Zombies! - Ok, so we know how to move, we know how to shoot, heck
we can't even move wherever we want... so now we need, yep zombies!
I want to shoot at something!. In rubyDogfight we mainly had multiplay,
and those multiplayer objects atleast made it fun to play with friends.
Lets change those to zombies and make them computer controlled...
which brings us to the next feature...

* AI - I know this might be rather hard, but lets make it simple... the only
thing the zombies should do, as a start! is avoid the collision objects and
move towards the player(s), when they get close to a player they start
beating the crap out of him (the "beating the crap out of him" could just 
be "emulated" bullets, with a very short range, we don't want those 
bastards to have some telekinesis attacks now do we? :P).

--- Extra Features (if time allows) ---
The features we have until now, makes the basic idea for the game. With 
these the games is atleast playable, and heck it could even be fun to 
play, now for some more "extravagant" ideas these don't need to be added 
in chronological order either.

* Multiplayer - I think this sholdnt be to hard to add as it's already 
implemented in RubyDogFight, but what we might need to add is features 
for Friendly Fire, it could be rather annoying if you hurt your own team 
mates in a game like this, so an option that lets you choose Friendly Fire, 
true or false to the game.

* Scrolling - Just having a static game field as we have in RubyDogFight 
could be a rather small area in this case, so lets make the game field scroll 
if we move towards the screen edges, this might need some fancy scroll 
algorithms to handle several players thou, and maybe a virtual collision 
wall, if the players walk to far away from eachother.

* Special attacks - Ok, so we are pirates, we have a gun that we can fire 
towards zombies, and this makes the game a typical top down 2D shooter 
scroller game. Lets make this "our" game!. A pirate is known for there elite 
fencing skills, and these zombies could indeed be alot to handle with a 
simple gun if they come too close to you... in masses, so I want to add a 
sort of streetfighter combo mode, that makes you deal basic blade swings 
and AOE attacks with combinations like A-A-B,  FWD-BCK-FWD-A, etc, 
etc. This is something that would distinct our game, from all the other top 
down 2D scrollers out there.
